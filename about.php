            <h2>What is Digital Electronics?</h2>
            <p>
                Digital electronics is a branch of electronics that deals with circuits and systems using digital signals. Unlike analog signals, 
                which vary continuously, digital signals have discrete values, usually represented as binary numbers (0s and 1s). Digital systems 
                form the foundation of modern technology, powering devices like computers, smartphones, and IoT gadgets.
            </p>

                The core components of digital electronics include logic gates, flip-flops, multiplexers, and memory units. These elements 
                work together to process and store information. Logic gates, for instance, perform basic operations like AND, OR, and NOT, 
                forming the building blocks of more complex circuits.
            </p>

                Digital electronics offers significant advantages over analog systems. It is less prone to noise and interference, ensuring 
                reliable communication and data processing. Additionally, digital systems are scalable, allowing for the development of highly 
                complex and integrated circuits such as microprocessors.
            </p>
            <p>
                This field has a wide range of applications, from consumer electronics and telecommunications to robotics and aerospace. 
                Innovations in digital electronics continue to drive advancements in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and quantum computing. 
                The ever-evolving nature of digital technology ensures its relevance and impact in the future.
